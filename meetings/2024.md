- Pedro
- Erin
- Bethany
- Bruna
- Will

**Apologies:**
- Joe (running a course)

### Introductions
New team members:
- Bruna
- Joe
- Harriet

### Packages
palaeoverse (Lewis): 
- Not too much going on. Several issues that need addressing. 
- Some to do with new functionality, some to do with preexisting functions.
- Idea for new function (developed by Bethany and Lewis), potentially for new members to take forward. 
rphylopic (Will):
- New version out! Now able to justify the Phylopic (left/right alignment), and can specify width as well as height.
- Doing very well ~15,000 downloads in the last year.
- However, people not being so hot on citing original image creators. Any ideas on how to improve this are welcome.
rmacrostrat (Lewis):
- Now live on CRAN (for over a month). Over 500 downloads so far.
- In review at Geosphere.
- Deeptime 2.0 (congrats Will!) uses rmacrostrat heavily in a new vignette.
- rmacrostrat grant has now closed. Reports have been sent, money has not been sent back yet. No further admin for grant going forwards.
sepkoski (Lewis):
- Next steps are to make a ggplot2 version.

### Open Palaeontology
Short pitch (Harriet):
- Harriet is starting a new Diamond access journal for palaeontology, currently looking for members to help take part.
- Aims to be able to report a variety of results that would not necessarily fit in other journals.
- Harriet not here this week, so will wait until next meeting to discuss fully.
  
### Account access
GitHub, Gmail, Slack, Google group:
- New members have joined, need to ensure access to various affiliated platforms.
- Lewis has admin rights, will provide this after this meeting.

### Events
Lecture series (Erin):
- 3rd lecture in the last block of talks last Thursday, now online. Next lecture is the end of September.
- Need to invite the next 4 speakers.
  - Have 4 people ready, just need to be formally invited.
  - Confirmed that the current list should be invited. Erin to remind on Slack.
- Also need to block next time zone. Currently have dropped in live viewership since shifting to new US timezone (dropped from ~60 to ~20 live viewers).
  - Advertising far in advance to ensure high numbers of attendees.
  - Pedro noted similar drop has occurred in PaleoPERCS.
  - Suggested to shift back to EU timezone and monitor attendance. 
CPEG workshop (Erin):
- Invited to give a workshop at the next CPEG meeting in July 2025.
- Proposal has been accepted and the wokshop will be held on July 27th.
- Will be similar to workshop given at NAPC, but expanded in terms of content, and covering both ecology and palaeontology.
- Looking for additional people to lead workshop. Feel free to put yourself down in the appropriate Google Sheet.
- Learn lessons from NAPC; timekeeping and preparation beforehand.
GSA workshop (Will):
- Putting in a proposal, but no confirmation yet. Is likely to be accepted, but won't be looked at until post 2024 meeting.
- Similar to proposal for CPEG; expand half day to a full day, including open science topics.
- Once again, anyone is welcome. No funding for travel.
Greenman Festival Outreach (Chris):
- Potential for running a science outreach stall at Greenman festival. This will kick off in early 2025.
- Let Chris know if you're interested in helping out.

### Resources
Directory and Grant Track(Lewis):
- Question about whether it's worth updating the Directory, particularly in regard to job applications.
- Could be just a labs/conferences Directory; seems to be a wise idea.
- Will keep these active for now.
- Sofia is potentially stepping back from this. New members can potentially fill in this spot.
Resource page (Chris):  
- Resources put together for the NAPC workshop.
- Currently available as an excel spreadsheet; suggested to keep this way so it can be pulled from the website.
- Will continue to update it. Encourage others to add to it as well.
- Can also be filled in during work for future workshops.
Website (Lewis):
- Lewis continuing to update and maintain it.
- Would be helpful to have an additional member to assist with this.
- Will can potentially help with automating the process. Will discuss offline. 
Minutes (Lewis):
- Going to do round robin of members from now on to ensure that it's not too much work. 
CRAN task view (Will):
- Will made new draft of list of packages back in June to adere to CRAN's input (too broad in some regards, too picky for specific packages)
- Now have a list of all specific palaeontology packages. Has received positive review so far.
- Next step will be prose RE each package.
Bluesky account (Bethany):  
- With Twitter dying, general shift to other social media sites (e.g. Bluesky, Threads).
- Bluesky has grown enough in palaeo-presence that it might be worth our time to make an account.
- Unsure about institutional account access (e.g. how many people can have access to an account).
- Bethany to investigate further before next meeting.
- Also suggestion to make an instagram account.

### Projects
Using R in palaeobiology: a review of recent developments and future directions/What has R done for palaeobiology? (Lewis):
- Aim to make review article that can tie in with CRAN task view.
- Aim to start in January.
- Will start a separate Slack channel to kick this off. 
10 rules for data cleaning (Lewis):
- Potential for an article/opinion piece along these lines for data cleaning in palaeo.
- Format is done in PLOS.
- Again, will discuss in separate Slack channel.
  
### Next meeting
2024-10-03, 14:00 UTC

### A.O.B.
Outgoing members?
- Several members not turned up to meetings in a while. Lewis to touch base to figure out whether they still want to be a part of the team.
Brazil Hackathon (Bruna):
- Suggestions for hackathon in Brazil, potentially run with Pedro.
- Pedro submitted a grant for additional funding for things like this; would be 5-6 years of funding.
- Will discuss further offline.
